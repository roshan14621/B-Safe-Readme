# B-Safe-Readme

## Problem Statement

Children are the future of the world and keeping them safe is our priority. As sad as it sounds, India or any part of the world cannot be called completely safe. Here is where we come. Whenever in distress, press a button and this will automatically notify people nearby of your location and others can respond to your distress call. This creates a social responsiblility among users and eliminates any central body ensuring quicker response to any distress call.
